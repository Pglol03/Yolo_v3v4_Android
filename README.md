A lot of research is going on in the
field of object detection. Different algorithms
pretrained or otherwise are being used for rendering
better accuracy and speed. YOLO is one such
algorithm which uses Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and it has several advantages
compared to other methods. In the current system,
YOLO v3 and v4 algorithms are used in android
apps for effective object detection and also to do a
comparative analysis of the results gathered from
the apps. TensorFlow Lite framework is used to
implement the YOLO algorithms while deploying
them in the android apps.
